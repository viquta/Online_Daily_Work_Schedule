# Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1:
- **Description**: I tried to use mssql but I kept getting connectivity problems.
- **Solution**: Decided to test with MariaDB

## Problem 2: 
- **Description**: my repo was getting thousands of clutter files which slowed down my development IDE.
- **Solution**: I made a new repo and included .gitignore


## Problem 2: Installation mariadb
- **Description**: when using the app for production, you should allow remote connection. However, you'll need to set up SSL/TLS to encrypt the connection. Further, you should also configure your firewall to allow connections from trusted sources.
- **Solution**: For development purposes, I did not allow remote connections so that I can focus on building the app first. I will look into encrypted connection in later stages of the development.
